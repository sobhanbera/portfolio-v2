Hello Geeks, I'm Sobhan Bera! I hold a deep interest & knowledge in Programming, especially in designing softwares. I am currently a professional full-stack web developer and full-stack android developer. At the time, I work for different clients to create and enhance their products.
\nExcept for this, I enjoy guiding and helping individuals who got stuck in any programming related problem. I have assisted many students in getting started with coding. I have also guided them to learn Git/GitHub from scratch.
\nMoreover, I like to read books. I also practice improving my cubing skills (Wanna watch me solve it? or I shouldn't have told this). And besides this if I got a chance I also enjoy cycling.
